# Angular Dependency Injection Task Manager

This project is a **Task Manager Application** developed using Angular and demonstrates advanced concepts of Dependency Injection (DI). The application enables users to create, manage, and track tasks with statuses such as Open, In-Progress, and Completed.

## Features

- **Task Management**:

  - Add tasks with a title and description.
  - Update task statuses (Open, In-Progress, Completed).
  - Filter tasks by status.

- **Dependency Injection Concepts**:
  - Centralized services for task management.
  - Custom Dependency Injection (DI) tokens and providers.
  - Element injectors and nested services.
  - Non-class values and alternative DI syntaxes.

## Project Highlights

This project was built while exploring the **Dependency Injection - Deep Dive** module, covering topics such as:

- Creating and providing Angular services.
- Using alternative DI syntax.
- Analyzing DI behavior with Angular DevTools.
- Injecting other values (not services).
- Reusing logic with services and modular design.
